Description: Plots the DAX returns from 2000 to 2011 and performs an F-test for variance comparison of specific time periods. From the plot a period of higher volatility is followed by a period of lower volatility and again followed by a period of higher volatility. To proof this finding, the time series is split into 3 intervals, each of which is tested against the other for variance comparison. The variances of the first and the third period differ significantly from the second period.

Keywords: plot, returns, dax, variance, test, testing, f-test, normality test
